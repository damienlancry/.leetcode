# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]'
#
# Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself
# (i.e., symmetric around its center).
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
# Output: true
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
# Output: false
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
#
#
#
# Follow up: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
#
